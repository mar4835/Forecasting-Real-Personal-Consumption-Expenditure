# Forecasting-Real-Personal-Consumption-Expenditure
This repository contains an Rmd and html file for forecasting of real personal consumption expenditure using 10 year data. Different models were run and plotted to forecast future consumption figures. Acf and decomposition was also run to further understand the results. Lastly, MAPE was used as the accuracy measure to determine the best model.
